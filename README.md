The application emulates the core functions of an operating system. It includes implementations for fundamental features such as process switching, priority scheduling, inter-process messaging, device management, paging, and virtual memory.
These functionalities collectively provide a simulated environment to an operating system, allowing to understand the essential operations within in an operating system.
The programming is done in Java, which uses threads and semaphores to distinguish between Userland and Kerneland, allowing for easier process switching. This design approach maintains a distinct distinction between user-level processes and kernel-level action, allowing for easy process management and context switching within the simulated operating system environment.
